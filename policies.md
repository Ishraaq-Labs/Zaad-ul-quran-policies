# Privacy Policy for Zaad ul Quran

**Last Updated: February 05, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how **Ishraaq Labs** ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application, **Zaad ul Quran** (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Microphone Usage (Audio Recording)
Our App requests access to your device's microphone (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`).
*   **Purpose**: This permission is used **solely** for the purpose of enabling voice-based search features (e.g., searching for a Surah or Ayah by voice) and for verifying your recitation against the Quran (if applicable).
*   **Data Handling**: Audio data is processed locally on your device or transiently sent to a speech-to-text service (like Google Speech-to-Text) to convert your voice commands into text. We **do not** store, record, or share your voice data on our servers.
*   **No User Identifiers**: We do not associate your voice data with any personal user identity.

### B. Personal Information
We do not collect any personal information (such as name, email address, phone number) through the App. The App functions primarily offline, with assets delivered via Google Play Asset Delivery.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the limited information described above only to:
*   Provide the core functionality of the App (displaying the Quran, audio playback, and voice search).
*   Improve the App's performance and user experience.

## 3. Disclosure of Information
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties.

## 4. Security
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your information. Since most operations are local to your device, your data remains with you.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 6. Contact Us
